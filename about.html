       <h2>Meaning of a rescue dog.</h2>
       <p>What does it mean to have a rescue dog in your home. It means everything! Have you ever wondered what you dog is thinking? Are they happy, sad, lonely. Do they love to play, snuggle or take a walk.</p> 
       <p>Imagine what a rescue dog is thinking when you come to the rescue facility. <i>"oh, I hope they come see me, pet me and let's play!"</i> You go into a visit room to see a furry friend and she/he is supe excited to meet you and thinking, <i>"please, take me home!"</i> Their energy is infecticious and you think,<i>"how could I not take you home."</i>The disappointment when they see you leave is so hurtful to them and they hope the next visitior will see them as family and take them home.</p>
       <p>Thinking back to when I rescued my recent furry friend Cranberry, I saw her on the rescue site and decided to go see her. I had lost my previous furry friends two labradors, one that year and the other the year before. As anyone who loses a pet, it is so hard to lose a family furry friend. On a side note, I have been a dog lover all my life with mostly having shepards and labradors. I have never had a smaller dog but the time had come when I saw her, to let another dog into my life. </p>
       <p>When I say the meaning of a rescue dog, when you rescue another furry friend, they bring some much to your life. They fill your heart with so much joy but also you bring so much to theirs.</p>
