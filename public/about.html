       <h2>Meaning of a rescue dog.</h2><br>
       <p>What does it mean to have a rescue dog in your home. It truly means everything! Have you ever wondered what you dog is thinking? Are they happy, sad, lonely. Do they love to play, snuggle or take a walk. Why do they follow you everywhere and how they know what you mean when you smile at them.</p> <br>
       <p>Imagine what a rescue dog is thinking when you come to the rescue facility. <i>"oh, I hope they come see me, pet me and let's play!"</i>  You go into a visit room to see a furry friend and she/he is super excited to meet you and thinking, <i>"please, take me home!"</i> Their energy is infecticious and you think,<i>"how could I not take you home."</i> Do we realize the disappointment they have when we leave that is so hurtful to them and they hope the next visitior will see them as family and take them home.</p><br>
       <p>Thinking back to when I rescued my recent furry friend Cranberry, I saw her on the rescue site and decided to go see her. I had lost my previous furry friends two labradors, one that year and the other the year before. As anyone who loses a pet, it is so hard to lose a family furry friend. On a side note, I have been a dog lover all my life with mostly having shepards and labradors. I have never had a smaller dog but the time had come when I saw her, to let another dog into my life.</p><br>
       <p>When I say the meaning of a rescue dog, when you rescue another furry friend, they bring some much to your life that you do not realize. They fill your heart with so much joy but also you bring so much to theirs.</p><br>

       <h3>A Rescue Dog's Perspective</h3><br>
       <p>Meaning from their perspective! As a dog owner, I often wonder what my furry friend is thinking when she greets me upon my returning home. Is she saying <i>"oh good, you're home, me, me ,me, pet me!"</i> It's funny because I think she does! She put her little paws up, wags her tail and jumps around with so much excitement. <i>Can you relate?</i></p><br>
       <p>I read a book once where the narrative was written by the dog's perspective. They tend to read us in their own way by hearing our raised voices, our laughs, how we react and this affect them. If we return home, they greet us and we walk on by like we don't have time for them, they are saddened by this. It's almost like they want to share with us, <i>"Hey, I'm here too, give me a pat please!"</i></p><br>
       <p>Dogs are loyal to their family in a sense that they are our protectors. They sense things and people, they feel your anxiousness and want to please you. The ultimate love that they give is endless, powerful and makes an impact on our lives.</p><br>

       <h3>The Gift of a Rescue Dog's Love</h3><br>
       <p>What they give us. If I could jot down every thing my rescue gives me, there wouldn't be enough room on a board or notes in a jar to handle the amount of goodness she brings me. <i>"Have you thought that way too?"</i> Rescues seem to have that undeniable love where they just want to be and feel loved. In some aspects, they are rescuing us just as much as we them.</p><br>
       <p>My little pup was a different kind of rescue. She went through a lot of trauma prior to being at the rescue facility. She was very timid, a single quick movement startled her, she didn't know how to play with toys or bark even and she didn't know what it was truly liked to be loved. The gift of having them in our lives brings us as much love as the love we give them</p><br>

       <h3>My Tips on adopting a Rescue</h3><br>
       <p>By adopting a rescue, you are saving your new furry friend by giving them a home and a second chance at a happy life. The unconditional love they give us, making us stay active and of course someone new to shop for. The gift of a rescue's dog love gives us the best gift of a lifelong best friend. Before adopting, please do research about the rescue organization, check their mission and values, visit the shelter location or rescue event and ask many questions.</p>
